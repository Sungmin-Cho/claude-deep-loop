# Changelog

All notable changes to deep-loop are documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-25 (v1)

Initial release of deep-loop v1, implemented across three plans.

### Plan 1 — Deterministic Kernel
- Content-hash-anchored state machine (`loop.json` + `.loop.hash`)
- Append-only event log with chain + head anchors; tamper-detect fail-stop
- Generation-fenced lease protocol (acquire/reserve/emit/spawn/release/rollback)
- Budget engine: turn/token/wallclock hard caps, `budget.on_unmeasurable_usage: "fail-closed"`
- Circuit breaker with human-only reset latch
- Comprehension debt tracking with idempotent `ack`
- Episode lifecycle (new → done/approved/rejected) with proof-artifact derivation
- Workstream management with dependency ordering and terminal-locked rewrites
- `initRun`, `readState`, `writeState`, `withLock` — all non-reentrant

### Plan 2 — Orchestration Machine
- `next-action` — pure gate evaluator (budget → breaker → sessions → wallclock → auto_handoff → action dispatch)
- `emitHandoff` — atomic child session push + lease reserved→emitted in one `appendAnchored` transaction
- `respawn` — spawn-or-rollback in one transaction; injected `spawnFn` for testability
- `respawnGate` — pure predicate; precompact hook calls respawn without pre-checking gate externally
- `review.mjs` — dispatch/record/settle for checker episodes
- `adapters.mjs` — 4-verb protocol descriptors (dispatch/await/read/checker_via) + tier guard
- Skill-facing CLI: `adapter resolve`, `state get/patch`, `budget record/check`, `comprehension ack/status`, `breaker reset`, `finish`, `episode new/record`, `workstream new/activate/record`, `review dispatch/record`
- All mutating CLI fenced with `--owner/--generation`; fence checked inside the lock (not outside)

### Plan 3 — Execution Plane + Automation + Docs
- 10 user-facing skills: `/deep-loop`, `/deep-loop-discover`, `/deep-loop-triage`, `/deep-loop-continue`, `/deep-loop-handoff`, `/deep-loop-resume`, `/deep-loop-status`, `/deep-loop-ack`, `/deep-loop-finish`, `/deep-loop-workflow` (internal)
- `spawn-driver.mjs` — `headlessSpawn` with timeout + `parseUsage`; fail-closed when usage unmeasurable (cost-only JSON rejected)
- `precompact-handoff.mjs` — PreCompact hook impl: emit + conditional headless respawn (best-effort, never blocks compaction)
- `hooks/hooks.json` + `hooks/scripts/precompact-handoff.sh` — Bash 3.2 compatible hook wiring
- `drive-headless.mjs` — unattended automation driver: fence-before-spawn, accounting carve-out for releasing lease
- `leaseCheck` accounting carve-out: `intent='accounting'` allowed during `releasing` (matching owner/generation only)
- `finish.mjs` — proof-gated run completion: all episodes settled + workstreams terminal + final-report
- Automation templates: `recipes/automation/cron-morning-triage.yml`, `recipes/automation/github-actions-loop.yml`
- User documentation: `README.md` (en), `README.ko.md` (ko), `CHANGELOG.md`
- `integration/deep-suite.patch.md` — marketplace registration patch plan (push-gated)

### Safety Invariants (all three plans)
- **proposal-only** — no auto-push, auto-merge, auto-publish, auto-delete in v1
- **2-plane separation** — skills read via CLI, write via kernel CLI only; no direct `loop.json` writes from skills
- **single-anchor transactions** — every event + state mutation in one `appendAnchored` call
- **fence-in-lock** — generation fence checked inside the same lock as the state change
- **fail-closed unmeasurable** — headless driver rejects sessions with no measurable turns/tokens
- **terminal via proof** — episode/workstream terminal states derived from verified artifacts only
